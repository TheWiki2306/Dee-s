            Hey my woman, you’re an amazement, a model of what a beautiful and strong woman is. <br/>
            You are a kind hearted, tender loving, beautifully caring woman who sees the best in me even when it looks ugly. <br/>
            As strong as you are as a person, you’re yet a soft lover at heart.<br/>
            Your mind is a creative cloud waiting to be explored. You’re amazing beyond what you think babe.<br/> 
            Sometimes, I try to imagine my life without you in it, and all I can visualize is dark clouds.<br/>
            You’ve come into my life with beautiful colors and experiences, you complete me. <br/>
            I wish I met your earlier, but our story might have probably been flawed.<br/> 
            I appreciate everyday that I get to see your face, play with you, kiss you, caress you, talk to you and argue with you.<br/>
            My partner in love and petty crime, the breath out of my lungs emanates with your love in it.<br/> 
            You’re are one in a billion babe, and I love you to the moon and back. 
            Thank you for being my Adebola, my Elle, my woman.<br/>

            <br/>
            Happy birthday baby!<br/>
            God bless you!!!
